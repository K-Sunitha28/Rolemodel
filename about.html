            The article is in WikiProject India because a bot (LostBot), which is an automated script, tagged it as an India-related article. In the words of the bot owner, "If an article is in the India category or subcategories they will get flagged as being part of the India project". Now this is absolutely fine, because this article does fall under some India-related categories (Category: Indian Americans and Category: Gujarati people to be precise). But I do not think that this categorization alone makes it a valid reason to add her name in Hindi. I have already explained my rationale behind removing the Hindi name in my previous entry on this talk page. There may not be a written rule or guideline about this (atleast I haven't read any), but going by other articles of people having similar status (offsprings/descendants of immigrants who were born in the USA and are American citizens by virtue of their birth), I believe that the Hindi name is not very relevant. However, to be sure, I will consult an admin about this and let you know his/her opinion.</p>
